# Running a Nock Maintainathon: The checklist

We've been trying something different over the past few months - running a Nock maintainathon every now and then. This is something like a Hackathon, but minus the overnighting. Basically, we synchronize our watches and meet up at a set date to work on something that needs to be done in Nock, in order to make the entire program better. This helps us get out of the weeds of dealing with support issues; helps the maintainers meet each other and hang out; and helps us cultivate a sense of community.

We've written several Medium posts on this process:

- [Maintain-a-thon for Nock](https://medium.com/nodenock/maintain-athon-for-nock-3a2a0fe982a9)
- [The Nock roadmap: Where we are, and where we are going](https://medium.com/nodenock/the-nock-roadmap-where-we-are-and-where-we-are-going-8844df218649?source=collection_home---6------1---------------------)
- [The Nock Maintainathon: Success!](https://medium.com/nodenock/the-nock-maintainathon-success-f0f5ae07457a)

Here, we want to lay out the specific checklist that should be done in order to set one of these up.

### Prerequisites

You will need access to these things:

- The [@nodenock](https://twitter.com/nodenock/) Twitter account. Ask @gr2m or @RichardLitt.
- The [@nodenock](https://medium.com/nodenock) Medium account. Ask Gregor or @RichardLitt.
- A premium Zoom account. (This allows us to have longer video calls. Otherwise, we can use Google Hangouts or some free service for multi-person calls.) @RichardLitt has a Zoom account we can use for now.
- The Gitter channel. We use this during the event to have synchronous chat as needed; really, though, Zoom seems to work.

## To Do

### Two Weeks Prior

- [ ] Create an issue suggesting a time for other maintainers. We tend to use an existing issue for this, but a new one would be fine.
- [ ] Pick a time. 12-16:00 EST seems to work best for us, given our distribution.
- [ ] **Choose something to hack on.** Otherwise, you're just going to have to pick stuff, and you lose focus during the event.
- [ ] Comment in https://github.com/nock/nock/issues/1268 with a comment saying there will be call:
  - [ ] Set up a standing Zoom video call for that time, and post a public link to it in this comment.
  - [ ] Mention what needs to be hacked on in this comment.
- [ ] Write up a blog post, as needed, which you can then publicize elsewhere. This hasn't been necessary for all of them, but it does help. Anything long form about why the hacking should get done would be ideal.
- [ ] Invite your friends at least a week before hand.
- [ ] Schedule some tweets using Buffer. Have these go out every day up until the call.
- [ ] Schedule a short call or email with other maintainers the night before to make sure that everything is ready.

### The Day Of

- [ ] Post in all channels that the event is happening in 30 minutes, on the day of the event.
- [ ] Turn on Gitter, again. We don't keep Gitter on permanently as it is a forum we can't moderate.
- [ ] Show up to the event.
- [ ] HACK.
- [ ] Try and close all work out - merge PRs during event, instead of later.
- [ ] Before it ends, write up a summary. Then: Tell people the event is over, so no one is confused. Post on Gitter and Twitter and in the GitHub issue.
- [ ] Celebrate.

This list is meant to be a work in progress. We'll edit it and improve it as we go.
