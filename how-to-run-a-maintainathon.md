# How to run a Nock maintainathon

We run a remote hackathon on every 2nd Friday of a month, at 12-4pm EST. Everyone is invited!

A Nock maintainathon is something like a hackathon, but minus the overnighting. Basically, we synchronize our watches and meet up at the same time to work on something that needs to be done in Nock, in order to make the entire project better. Itâ€™s also an opportunity to meet each other face to face.

If you plan to help hosting a Nock maintainathon, here is a check list:

### Prerequisites

You will need access to these things:

- The [@nodenock](https://twitter.com/nodenock/) Twitter account. Ask [@gr2m](https://github.com/gr2m) or [@RichardLitt](https://github.com/RichardLitt).
- A Zoom account. (This allows us to have longer video calls. Otherwise, we can use Google Hangouts or some free service for multi-person calls.) [@RichardLitt](http://github.com/RichardLitt) has a Zoom account we can use for now.

## To Do

### Two Weeks Prior

- [ ] **Choose something to hack on.** Otherwise we are just going to have to pick stuff, and you lose focus during the event.
- [ ] Comment in https://github.com/nock/nock/issues/1268 with a comment saying there will be call:
  - [ ] Set up a standing Zoom video call for that time, and post a public link to it in this comment.
  - [ ] Mention what needs to be hacked on in this comment.

### The week of

- [ ] Invite your friends
- [ ] Post a public invitation on twitter

### The Day Of

- [ ] Post a reminder on twitter 30 minutes before the event
- [ ] Show up to the event. Welcome everyone who joines throughout the event
- [ ] Do some fun work :)
- [ ] Try and close all work out - merge PRs during event, instead of later.
- [ ] Before it ends, write up a summary. Then: Tell people the event is over, so no one is confused. 
- [ ] Celebrate ðŸŽ‰
- [ ] Update the comment on https://github.com/nock/nock/issues/1268 with a summary of what has been worked on

This list is meant to be a work in progress. We'll edit it and improve it as we go.
