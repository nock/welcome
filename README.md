# Welcome to Nock!

Nock is a free and Open Source software project.

Nock is also a welcoming community! We appreciate any kind of contribution: bug reports, code, design, documentation, editorial, event organization, issue triaging, sponsorship, and anything else you can think of.

If you have a question on how to get started, please open an issue in this repository 😀

### 👀 Triaging

Triaging issues and pull requests is very helpful to make sure that all information has been provided by the author in order to work on them. Describing the process of Triaging is something we should do in more detail, but for now it would be very helpful to see if all issues have the right label and if all answers have been filled out. We ask people who report a bug to provid a reproducable test case using a [RunKit](https://runkit.com/) notebook. If none was provided, adding one would be a great help.

### 💵 Sponsoring
