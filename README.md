# welcome

ðŸ‘‹ The Nock organization welcome repo

This repository is a work in progress. Take a look a that [the issues](https://github.com/nock/welcome/issues) for now. Ideally, this repository will eventually combine documentation for multiple repositories in the Nock organization. This may have to wait until after our tests in Nock are decent enough to begin modularizing the code.
