Design can mean a lot of different things. If you’d like to take a stab at a new nock logo or other branding artifacts, you can create an issue in this repository. If you’d like to create visualizations for our documentation or slides we could share with everyone who’d like to give a talk about nock, open an issue in this repository as well.

### 📖 Documentation

### 📝 Editorial

### 👀 Triaging

Triaging issues and pull requests is very helpful to make sure that all information has been provided by the author in order to work on them. Describing the process of Triaging is something we should do in more detail, but for now it would be very helpful to see if all issues have the right label and if all answers have been filled out. We ask people who report a bug to provid a reproducable test case using a [RunKit](https://runkit.com/) notebook. If none was provided, adding one would be a great help.

### 💵 Sponsoring
